#### **Useful information**

- A number of apps provide detailed information on cookies, including [AboutCookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/) and [AllAboutCookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).
- The European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance app [Your Online Choices](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk) allows you to install opt-out cookies across different advertising networks.
- Google has developed a browser add-on to allow users to [opt-out of Google Analytics](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) across all apps which use it. This is also [available in the Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-analytics-opt-out/fllaojicojecljbmefodhfapmkghcbnh?hl=en).
- Some browsers include a feature known as &#39;Do Not Track&#39; or DNT. This allows you to indicate a preference that apps should not track you. However, whilst DNT is available in many browsers, apps are not required to recognise its request, so it may not always work. You can get help on how to use DNT in [Microsoft Edge](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10-microsoft-edge-and-privacy), [Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/17288/windows-internet-explorer-11-use-do-not-track), [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/settings-privacy-browsing-history-do-not-track), Chrome, [Safari](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/safari/prevent-websites-from-tracking-you-sfri40732/mac) and [Opera](https://help.opera.com/en/latest/security-and-privacy/#tracking).
