## CLIENTS&#39; TERMS:

## 10. Booking Creative Activities

  1. You can search for the relevant Creative Activities and events by using Artsflow search and the specific criteria like the type of service, type of activity, dates, etc. You can also use filters to refine your search results. Search results are based on their relevance to your search and other criteria. Relevance considers factors like price, availability, reviews, customer service and cancellation history, popularity, previous Creative Activities and saved Listings, requirements provided by the Creatives, such as the level of skill or knowledge or any specific age restrictions and more.
  
  2. When you book a Listing, you are agreeing to pay all charges for your booking including the Listing price, applicable fees like Artsflow&#39;s service fee, offline fees, taxes and any other items identified during checkout (collectively, &quot;Total Price&quot;). You are also agreeing that Artsflow&#39;s Payments may charge and collect any security deposit identified. When you receive the booking confirmation, a contract with the relevant Creative for the relevant Creative Activity is formed directly between you and the Creative. The cancellation policy and any other rules, standards, policies, or requirements identified in the Listing or during checkout form part of your contract with the Creative. Be aware that some Creatives may work with a co-Creative or as part of a team to provide their Creative Activity. For the avoidance of doubt, Artsflow cannot monitor the provision of every single Creative Activity and will not monitor the terms of each Creative Activity, unless those terms violate any laws or these Terms. By booking a Creative Activity you agree to both these Terms and any specific rules and requirements imposed by such activity organisers and the Creatives.

  3. A Creative Activity reservation is a limited license to view, use browse, participate, or otherwise take part in the relevant Creative Activity. The Creative organiser retains all the rights, including the intellectual property rights to such an activity.
  
  4. When booking a Creative Activity, You are responsible for confirming that you, and anyone you invite, meet minimum age, proficiency, fitness or other requirements. You are responsible for informing the Creative of any medical or physical conditions, or other circumstances that may impact your ability to participate, attend or use the Creative Activity.

In the event that Artsflow has obtained its own liability insurance that covers your Creative Activity, your insurance will be the primary source of coverage and Artsflow&#39;s insurance will operate as excess or secondary insurance for any amounts exceeding your coverage.

## 21. Contests, Sweepstakes and Promotions and other Events

  1. Any contests, sweepstakes or other promotions and events (collectively, &quot;Promotions&quot;) made available through our Platform may be governed by rules that are separate from these Terms and Conditions. If you participate in any Promotions, please review the applicable rules as well as our Privacy Policy. If the rules for a Promotion conflict with these Terms and Conditions, the relevant Promotion&#39;s rules will apply.

## 22. Resolving complaints and other claims

  1. If a User provides evidence to make a complaint or another claim against another User, the complaining User can seek compensation. If the complaining User escalates a Claim to Artsflow, the other User will be given an opportunity to respond. If the responding User agrees to pay, or Artsflow determines under consideration of any applicable statutory rules on the burden of proof that they are responsible for the Claim, Artsflow via Payments can collect any sums required to cover the Claim from the responding User and/or against any security deposit.

  2. Artsflow may also pursue against you any remedies it may have available under applicable law. You agree to cooperate in good faith, provide any information Artsflow requests, execute documents, and take further reasonable action, in connection with Claims, Client complaints, claims under insurance policies, or other claims related to your provision or use of Creative Activities. You may appeal a decision by Artsflow by contacting our customer service. Any decisions made by Artsflow in relation to a Claim do not affect your contractual and statutory rights. Your right to take legal action before a court of law remains unaffected.

  3. For disputes arising between Clients and Creatives, you agree to abide by the dispute process that is explained in our Client Refund Policy and in this section and on our Platform. If the dispute process does not resolve your dispute, you may pursue your dispute independently, but you acknowledge and agree that Artsflow will not and is not obligated to provide any dispute assistance beyond what is provided in these terms.

## 23. Artsflow&#39;s role

  1. Artsflow offers a platform that enables Creatives, Members and other Users to publish, offer, search for, and book Creative Activities. When Users make or accept a booking, they are entering into a contract directly with each other. Artsflow is not and does not become a party to or other participant in any contractual relationship between the Users.

  2. For the avoidance of doubt, Artsflow is not acting as an agent for any Member or User except for where Artsflow has expressly stated so.

  3. While we work hard to ensure our Users have great experiences using Artsflow, we do not and cannot control the conduct or performance of Clients and Creative and do not guarantee (i) the existence, quality, safety, suitability, or legality of any Listings or Creative Activities or (ii) the truth or accuracy of any Listing descriptions, Reviews, or other Content provided by Creatives or Clients.

  4. You hereby acknowledge that Artsflow has no general obligation to monitor the use of the Artsflow Platform and verify information provided by our Members, Creatives and Users, but has the right to review, disable access to, remove, or edit Content to: (i) operate, secure and improve the Platform (including for fraud prevention, risk assessment, investigation and customer support purposes); (ii) ensure Users&#39; compliance with these Terms; (iii) comply with applicable law or the order or requirement of a court, law enforcement or other administrative agency or governmental body; (iv) address Content that we determine is harmful or objectionable; (v) take actions set out in these Terms; and (vi) maintain and enforce any quality or eligibility criteria, including by removing Listings that don&#39;t meet quality and eligibility criteria. Where we remove or disable Content, we will notify a User and provide the reasons for such a measure, unless such notification would (i) prevent or impede the detection or prevention of fraud or other illegal activities, (ii) harm the legitimate interests of other Users or third parties, or (iii) contravene applicable laws.

  5. You may appeal such a decision by contacting our customer service. Users agree to cooperate with and assist Artsflow in good faith, and to provide Artsflow with such information and take such actions as may be reasonably requested by Artsflow with respect to any investigation undertaken by Artsflow regarding the use or abuse of the Platform.

## 24. DISCLAIMER

  1. We make an effort to ensure the Creatives whose details we provide are legitimate, reputable and have appropriate qualifications, membership to and/or approval of trade related bodies organisations and associations and that the information we had is accurate, the information is compiled from details supplied to us from the Creatives and we cannot be held responsible for any errors or inaccuracies in such information or for the suitability or quality of any services or goods supplied to Clients through our Service.

  2.
